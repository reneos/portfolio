        <h2>Team Role</h2>
        <p>Snapcarte was built in a team of 3 over the period of <strong>10 days</strong> as a final product sprint for the LeWagon Bootcamp. I served as <strong>Lead Dev</strong> on the team. In addition to overseeing the overall structure of the app, I also focused my efforts on the OCR aspect.</p>

      <h2>Autofill</h2>
      <p>We wanted to explore ways to make the restaurant sign-up process as <strong>quick and easy</strong> as possible, so we devised a way for owners to paste in their <strong>TripAdvisor</strong> links, which Snapcarte would use to autofill restaurant details.</p>

      <h2>Menu OCR</h2>
      <p>For the busy restaurant owner who isn't so tech-savvy, we decided on an OCR feature that would allow restaurant owners to <strong>upload a photo of their menu and have Snapcarte digitize it</strong>. Owners could also <strong>crop sections of their menu</strong>, improving menu organization and optimizing OCR.</p>

      <h2>Editing the Menu</h2>
      <p>After OCR is complete, the owner is taken to a menu overview page where they can <strong>name the different sections that were cropped</strong> as well as correct any OCR artifacts in dish names or prices.</p>
